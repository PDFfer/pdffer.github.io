## PluralSight Exercise Files

If you are following the Spring Boot course on PluralSight (Spring Boot:
  Effective Development,ã€€Configuration and Deployment), it is important that
  you try as much as possible to follow the lectures and demos while keeping
  the corresponding code open in your IDE, ready for you to play with and
  experiment. This is very important because I do not know of any other to
  become a good programmer than by programming.

This page explains how to set up Eclipse with Spring Tools 4 and IntelliJ
  Ultimate so that you have everything ready to follow along during lectures
  and demos.  

The exercise files contain configuration files for two build tools: Maven and
Gradle

### Maven

#### Eclipse with Spring Studio 4
#### IntelliJ Ultimate

### Gradle

#### Eclipse with Spring Studio 4
